# New Media Player

New Media Player - an approach at using diffusion models to create a content engine to compete with Youtube, Tiktok, and Instagram. 

This is what a bicycle for the mind looks like. Don't doom-scroll for content. Draw it and consume it 

## Technical Accomplishments

We're proud to present our key technical achievements:

1. **Custom Canvas Creation**: We've developed a new canvas from scratch, enabling the conversion of drawings into base64 data. This data then serves as prompts for diffusion engines. Notably, this feature was built without relying on React Native or out-of-the-box React packages, setting our canvas apart in functionality and design.

2. **Bezier Curve Drawing**: In an effort to enhance user interactivity, we've implemented Bezier curves on our canvas, allowing users to create more natural and complex drawings. This feature is built from scratch, as no existing React package provides support for this level of drawing complexity.

3. **Dynamic UI Rendering**: Our platform dynamically renders images and text based on the audio track's content. This innovative feature provides a seamless and engaging user experience, merging visual and auditory content in real-time.
